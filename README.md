The objective of this analysis is to enhance Yelp restaurant review scores by concentrating on feedback specifically related to food and service. Traditional Yelp ratings amalgamate all user reviews, which can obscure individual aspects such as food quality or service experience. This analysis seeks to deliver more detailed ratings, enabling users to swiftly identify restaurants based on their particular preferences.
